Endless-Rooms is a 2D platformer I made to improve my programming skills:
- It uses [PySFML](https://github.com/intjelic/python-sfml) instead of [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to allow for more advanced graphics (parallax effects with the background, shades, colored lighting etc.).
- The game is now programmed using Object Oriented Paradigm.
- The game even has a "network" aspect with a level editor and a server that allows for saving/retrieving edited levels.

The game is nevertheless not that simple, with a few game mechanics implemented:
- You can jump over multiple obstacles that make you lose health if you touch them. Different damages are applied depending on the type of obstacle.
- Monsters you can dodge or shot at are present and run towards you.
- The end of a level might need to be unlocked by putting braziers on fire with your attacks. You'll have to find the braziers and success at shooting at them.
- Bumpers that allow you to jump higher than your regular jump are implemented. They can be used as a tool to access platforms, or as traps to dodge to avoid pikes...

Endless-Rooms is endless because you can create as much levels as you want through the editor.

Here's a picture of the game (still made with Paint but a little bit better):
